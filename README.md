# Machine-Learning-Project

This project will analyse and perform some predictions using the data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of 6 participants. These participants were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise, which is the “classe” variable in the training set. The prediction model will also be used in the end to predict 20 different test cases.
